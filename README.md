# Random Joke using API

This project will generate random jokes using API links.

First, we will make a box on the web page and add a title. Then we will create an area in which all the joke generators will be seen.

Below the area will be a generate button that will generate a different joke each time it is clicked on.

We will not use any text manually. Here we will use an API link to collect all the information from other places with the help of the fetch method and then display it on the webpage with the help of textContent.
